\paragraph{Title: } Submerged Echoes

\paragraph{Genre: } Thrust-like, Puzzle, Mystery

\paragraph{Visual style: } Geometric/Low Poly

\paragraph{Short Description: } A batyscaphe has to investigate the sinking of a submarine

\paragraph{Setting: } The game is set in the deep of the ocean

\paragraph{Main Characters: } The main character is the pilot of the bathyscaphe

\paragraph{Synopsis: } The story is about the pilot of a bathyscaphe who is sent investigating the
sinking of a submarine in the deep of the ocean.
Soon the pilot finds the submarine who crushed in a cave without explanations, thus he set off to find
the black box.
He descends into a tunnel in which he, mysteriously, finds the black box along with a strange statue.
Returning back he notices that a new tunnel has appeared: he can then chose if going down this mysterious new tunnel or returning back to surface.
Descending in the newfound tunnel he hears strange voices and distant calls and finally finds himself in a room with an enormous statue, with three empty sockets in place of the eyes.
The pilot then explores the nearby tunnels, overcoming difficulties and traps, in order to retrieve the orbs and place them back again in the statue.
When the pilot places all the orbs in the sockets a earthquake starts and he is filled with dreadful images and horrific scenes... Then the game ends.
\paragraph{Rules and Mechanics: } 
\begin{itemize}
\item The main goal of the game is to complete the main story, completing all the levels;
\item The control system is inspired by Thrust and similar games: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item With two keys (Q/E) the player can control the rotation of the bathyscaphe;
	\item With another key (Space) the player can apply thrust and thus move the bathyscaphe forward.
	\end{itemize}
\item When the bathyscaphe hits a wall or other obstacles it explodes and the game restarts from the first level;
\item In some levels the player is able to choose between alternative actions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Requirements: } \begin{itemize}
\item Low-poly geometric model of the bathyscaphe;
\item Low-poly geometric model of the submarine;
\item Low-poly geometric model of the statues;
\item Low-poly geometric scenes/levels
\end{itemize}
